concept of reusability inn c++ is supported by using inheritance
existing class is called as the base class
the new class which is inherited is called as derived class

forms of inheritance:
1. single inheritance (derived class with only one base class)
2. multiple inheritance (derived class with more than oine base class)
3. hierarchical inheritance (several derived class from a single base class)
4. multilevel inheritance (deriving a class from already derived class)
5. hybrid inheritance (combination of multiple inheritance and multi-level inheritance)  AAAAAAAA
